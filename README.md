# Zalando-Price-Tracker
This project describes a Python program which is able to track prices from Zalando (or any other web scrapping capable website) and informs the user by e-mail as soon as the price fell below a given price level. Additionally, the code contains multiple functions to retrieve the title, brand and price rating of three different Zalando products.
